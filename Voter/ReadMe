ReadMe

I Swapped everything over to use the same library as you.  So this should be pretty simple.

Run ./docker-build.sh   (You may need to chmod 755)

This should build each docker image and then deploy them.

if you jsut copy and paste -  youll add 2 polls, and 2 voters,   The only HATEOAS i have is on the "voter" api, where you get a link to the votes -   That structure is difficult to put in due to most of my api readily supplying the data.
